# MudMuseum - A History over a Half-Century

Multi-User Dungeons (MUDs) originated near the beginnings of the internet, relative to what we think of today. To quote
[Wikipedia's MUD entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD),

> A MUD is a multiplayer real-time virtual world, usually text-based. MUDs combine elements of role-playing games, hack 
> and slash, player versus player, interactive fiction, and online chat. 

If this sounds like an ancient predecessor to MMORPGs, you'd be correct,

> The history of modern massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) like EverQuest and Ultima Online, can
> be traced directly back to the MUD genre.
