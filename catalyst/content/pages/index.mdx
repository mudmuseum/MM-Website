### Lists

Markdown supports ordered (numbered) and unordered (bulleted) lists.

Unordered lists use asterisks, pluses, and hyphens -- interchangably
-- as list markers:

- Red
- Green
- Blue

Ordered lists use numbers followed by periods:

1.  Bird
2.  McHale
3.  Parish

### Emphasis

_single underscores_

_Some more text in italics to get a better feel for how it can look. Here it goes just continuing on._

**double asterisks**

**Some more BOLD text. This really draws attention to it and helps to give a feel for what it looks like just a bit longer.**

### Anchor 1

This section is used to test [react-scroll](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scroll). It also gives the feel for the flow of some text and an image, _similar to a blog post_.
